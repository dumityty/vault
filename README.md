# SlimPHP Skeleton App

This is a skeleton app to get you started with SlimPHP.

> Slim is a PHP micro framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs

There is a document on google drive which explains how to set up stuff and get you started:
[PHP - SlimPHP Skeleton Api](https://docs.google.com/a/zoocha.com/document/d/1bBtBM-erkxC3lixgW3qatozEtsRhcuMF27Ao7qKtaZ8/edit#)

To use this skeleton app and start building on top of it just clone it and run:

```sh
composer install
```

This will download all the necessary packages from the composer.json file and create a new folder called 'vendor' with all the packages. This folder is ignored from git!
